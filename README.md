React Tool Template
====================

A template to get started with when building a tool for intermine/steps.

How to use:
-------------

Clone this repository and get editing! In particular you will need to:
 * Change the `main.js` file to do what you want. The main component should
   control a tree of other sub-components beneath it, and send events back to
   the main context.
 * Change the `demo`, `tool` and `test` indicies to instantiate the tool correctly, and send the
   right events for your needs.
